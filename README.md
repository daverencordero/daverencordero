###  💬 Hello！ I'm Dave Cordero

I'm a self-taught graphic designer looking to translate my artwork into web design. I've fallen in love with front-end web development in the past years. Now I'm looking to optimize the currently available web technology to express myself as an artist fully.

**Things about me :**

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **React Component Library Development**, **Advanced SASS*, and **Advanced Typescript**
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on **Web Applications** or **Community Projects**
- ❓ Ask me about **CSS and Web Development**
- 💼 I'm currently working in  [**Xtendly**](https://xtendly.com/) and [**Prosperna**](https://www.prosperna.com/) 
- 🔴 **日本語**も勉強している
